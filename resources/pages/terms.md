### 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

### 2. The Service

deepseekocr.io provides a user interface to access the DeepSeek-OCR model for processing images, PDFs, and other documents ("User Content") to extract text and structured data. The Service is offered through a free trial tier with usage limits and various paid subscription tiers ("Paid Tiers").

You retain all ownership rights to the User Content you submit to the Service. However, by submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, process, and display your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service. This license terminates when you delete your User Content or your account. We will not use your User Content for marketing or share it with third parties except as necessary to provide the Service.

### 5. Fees and Payment
