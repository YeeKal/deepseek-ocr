## The Art of Instruction: Key Principles for Crafting FLUX.1 Kontext Prompts

To get the best out of FLUX.1 Kontext, you need to speak its language. It’s less about painting a poetic picture with words and more about giving clear, actionable directions.

Command with Verbs: Use action words! “Change,” “replace,” “add,” “remove,” “transform” are your best friends. Be mindful, as “change” might yield different results than “transform.”
Preserve What’s Perfect: Use “while maintaining…” or “keeping…” clauses to tell the AI what not to alter. For example, “…while maintaining the same facial features.” This is crucial for preventing unwanted changes.
Specificity is Your Superpower: Ambiguity is your enemy. Name your subjects clearly (e.g., “the woman with short black hair” instead of “she”). Specify art styles (e.g., “1960s pop art poster style” not just “make it artistic”). Detail colors, textures, and lighting.
Iterate, Iterate, Iterate: Don’t try to do everything in one go. Break complex transformations into a sequence of simpler edits. FLUX.1 is built for this step-by-step refinement.
Mind the Limit: Prompts have a 512-token limit. For complex edits, break them into smaller, sequential instructions for better control and results.
