        items: [
            { question: "How does AI video generation work?", answer: "Our cutting-edge AI models are trained on extensive datasets of videos and images. They master the ability to create natural motion, understand complex camera paths, and generate entirely new visual imagery. For 'photo-to-video' tools, the AI meticulously analyzes your input image, intelligently constructs a dynamic 3D scene around it, and then animates a seamless camera movement. For 'text-to-video', the AI interprets your written words to spontaneously generate a visual scene or animation from scratch." },
            { question: "What types of videos can I create with your AI tools?", answer: "Currently, our standout feature is the incredibly popular 'Zoom Out Earth' effect, which transforms a single photo into a breathtaking journey from ground to space. We are continuously expanding our suite of innovative tools, with ongoing development for AI-powered animated slideshows, dynamic text-to-video animations, and advanced video style transfer effects. Stay tuned for exciting new additions!" },
            { question: "Are the AI video tools free to use?", answer: "We offer a convenient free plan that allows you to explore our AI video generation tools and download your initial creations. Please note that videos generated under the free plan will include a watermark. For unwatermarked, high-quality outputs, and access to premium features, we offer flexible paid subscription plans designed to suit a range of creative and professional needs." },
            { question: "What formats can I upload and download?", answer: "For input, you can typically upload standard image formats such as JPEG and PNG. Your final AI-generated video will be delivered as a high-quality MP4 file, ensuring broad compatibility with all leading social media platforms, video editing software, and presentation tools." },
            { question: "Can I use the videos I create for commercial purposes?", answer: "Absolutely. All videos created using our platform are licensed for commercial use. This means you can confidently use them for marketing campaigns, compelling social media advertisements, professional presentations, client projects, and any other commercial application where you aim to make a significant visual impact. We encourage you to review our full terms of service for complete details." },
            { question: "How is my data used when I upload a photo?", answer: "We prioritize your privacy and data security. Your uploaded photos are used exclusively for the purpose of generating your requested video. They are processed securely using industry-standard protocols and are not utilized for any other purpose, shared with third parties, or added to any training datasets. All uploaded files are automatically deleted from our servers after a short, defined period to ensure your privacy." },
            { question: "What resolution are the generated videos?", "answer": "Our AI-generated videos are optimized for high-definition (HD) quality, delivering crisp and clear visuals that are perfect for online platforms. This resolution ensures quick loading times and excellent playback on mobile devices, desktops, and all popular social media channels, providing a fantastic viewing experience." }

            { question: "Is the Zoom Out Earth AI effect free to use?", answer: "You can try our Zoom Out Earth generator with a free trial, which includes a watermark on the output video. For high-quality, watermark-free videos, you'll need to subscribe to one of our premium plans. We offer flexible options to suit your creative needs." },
            { question: "How does the AI turn one photo into a Zoom Out Earth video?", answer: "Our advanced AI leverages several cutting-edge techniques. First, it constructs a 'depth map' from your input photo to precisely understand foreground and background elements. Next, it employs sophisticated generative AI to seamlessly create plausible aerial and satellite imagery extending outward from your starting point. Finally, it animates a dynamic 3D camera path through this newly generated virtual environment to achieve the perfect Zoom Out Earth effect." },
            { question: "What kind of photos work best for the Zoom Out Earth effect?", answer: "For optimal results, utilize a clear, well-lit photo with a distinct and well-defined subject. Portraits, images of prominent single objects or buildings, and landscapes with a clear focal point typically yield the best Zoom Out Earth videos. Try to avoid overly busy backgrounds or heavily filtered images, as these can hinder the AI's analytical capabilities." },

It is entirely generated by our proprietary AI to create a visually consistent, seamlessly flowing, and artistic effect. The primary goal is a breathtaking cinematic look, not cartographic accuracy." },
