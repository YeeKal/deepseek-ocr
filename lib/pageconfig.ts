    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What is DeepSeek-OCR?",
        answer: "DeepSeek-OCR is a new vision-language model that specializes in recognizing and extracting text and data from documents using an innovative technique called 'Contexts Optical Compression'."
      },
      {
        question: "What makes 'Contexts Optical Compression' different?",
        answer: "Instead of converting every detail of an image into a large number of tokens, it intelligently compresses the visual information. This means it can represent a full, complex page with up to 10x fewer data points than traditional models, making it incredibly fast and efficient."
      },
      {
        question: "Is DeepSeek-OCR free to use?",
        answer: "Yes, the model is open-source and the live demo on this site is free to use. For commercial or large-scale use, you can access the model weights and code from the official GitHub repository."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there an official API available?",
        answer: "Currently, there is no official hosted API. However, the project is open-source, allowing you to deploy and host your own instance. We recommend following the GitHub project for future announcements about a public API."
      },
      {
        question: "What file types can I analyze?",
        answer: "The underlying model can process a wide range of image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP) and is particularly effective on pages from PDF documents. The live demo supports direct image uploads and pastes."
      },
      {
        question: "How does this compare to Tesseract or other OCR libraries?",
        answer: "DeepSeek-OCR is an end-to-end deep learning model that excels at understanding complex layouts, like tables and charts, which traditional OCR libraries often struggle with. Its primary advantage is superior efficiency and accuracy on dense, structured documents."
      },
      {
        question: "What languages does the model support?",
        answer: "The model was trained on a massive dataset covering nearly 100 languages, making it highly effective for multilingual document analysis."
      },
      {
        question: "Can it understand document structure, not just text?",
        answer: "Absolutely. This is a key strength. It can parse charts into structured data, understand tables, and recognize layouts, converting them into clean formats like Markdown."
