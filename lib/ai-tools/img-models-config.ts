          { question: "What kind of edits can I make with Kontext Pro ?", answer: "You can perform local edits (e.g., change color, add/remove objects), apply style transfers, inpaint/outpaint, and ensure character consistency across edits." },
          { question: "How does 'local editing' work?", answer: "You provide an image and a text prompt describing the change you want in a specific area (e.g., 'make the red car blue'). The AI then intelligently applies that change." },
          { question: "What is 'style reference' in FLUX.1 Kontext Pro ?", answer: "It's the ability to take the artistic style from one image (a reference) and apply it to another, or to describe a style in text to be applied to your image." },
          { question: "Do I need to be precise with masking for edits?", answer: "Often, FLUX.1 Kontext Pro can infer the area of interest from your text prompt. For more complex edits, masking tools might be used in conjunction (if supported by the UI)." },
          { question: "How does this compare to traditional photo editing software?", answer: "It complements traditional software by offering powerful AI-driven edits that can be complex or time-consuming manually, especially those requiring content generation or deep contextual understanding." },
          { question: "Is this model suitable for restoring old photos?", answer: "Yes, its inpainting and contextual understanding capabilities can be very effective for tasks like removing scratches or reconstructing missing parts of old photographs." },
          { question: "Does it work well for product photography edits?", answer: "Absolutely. It can be used to change backgrounds, clean up imperfections, or even generate variations of a product within an image." }

## Qwen-Image: The Technical Report

![qwen image showcase](https://cdn.kontextflux.io/qwen-image/summary/merge3.webp)

### Unparalleled Text Rendering: A Game-Changer for Creatives

One of the most significant advancements offered by Qwen-Image is its superior ability to render text within images. This feature addresses a long-standing challenge in AI image generation, enabling the creation of visually coherent and contextually accurate images with embedded text.

### Key Text Rendering Features:

*   **Multi-language Support:** Qwen-Image seamlessly renders both English and Chinese text, preserving the nuances of each language. This makes it an invaluable tool for global marketing campaigns, multilingual content creation, and cross-cultural artistic expression.
*   **Complex Layouts:** The model can handle multi-line text, paragraphs, and intricate layouts with remarkable precision. This opens up new possibilities for generating posters, infographics, and other text-heavy visuals directly from a prompt.
*   **In-Image Text Accuracy:** Whether it's a sign on a storefront, text on a t-shirt, or the cover of a book, Qwen-Image integrates text into the visual fabric of the image with stunning accuracy.

### Image Editing Capabilities: A Feature-by-Feature Showdown

The following table provides a clear, concise, and feature-by-feature comparison of the editing functionalities offered by each model. For web application developers, this directly informs feature planning, helps identify potential gaps, and aids in selecting the most appropriate models for desired editing workflows.

### Key Features and Abilities

- **Multi-Image Fusion:** Seamlessly blend elements from up to three different images to create a single, photorealistic composition. This is perfect for creating dynamic product mockups or imaginative scenes. 
- **Character Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look for characters or subjects across a series of images, changing their poses, expressions, or environments without losing their identity. This is a game-changer for storytelling and branding.
- **Conversational Editing:** Engage in a natural, multi-turn dialogue to refine your images. Start with a concept and provide iterative feedback like "make the background blurrier" or "change the shirt color to blue" for precise control. 
- **Advanced World Knowledge:** Backed by the power of Gemini, the model understands complex, real-world concepts and can interpret nuanced instructions, including those based on sketches or diagrams.
- **Targeted Transformations:** Execute precise edits such as adding or removing objects, altering poses, changing colors, and restoring old photos with simple text prompts. 
- **SynthID Watermarking:** To ensure transparency and responsible use, all images created with Gemini 2.5 Flash are embedded with an invisible SynthID watermark, identifying them as AI-generated. 

### Applications

- Character creation for stories and games
- Dynamic product ad generation
- Interior design and architectural visualization
